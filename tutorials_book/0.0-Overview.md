# 🧠 NNDb-3T+: The Naturalistic Neuroimaging Tutorial

Welcome to the official tutorial resource for the **Naturalistic Neuroimaging Database (NNDb-3T+)**!

This open-access resource combines rich, **naturalistic fMRI data** (movie-watching) with specialized **functional mapping tasks** and **multimodal data** (like eye-tracking). Our goal is to provide neuroscientists and data scientists with a hands-on guide to leverage the full complexity of this database.
