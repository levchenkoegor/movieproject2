# 🛠️ Environment Setup

To ensure all tutorials run flawlessly, we rely on a **reproducible software environment** managed by [**Conda** or **Mamba**].

This tutorial book primarily uses **Python** and standard neuroimaging libraries like **NiBabel**, **Nilearn**, and **DataLad** for efficient data access.

### Step 1: Install Conda or Mamba

If you don't already have one, install a Python environment manager. **Mamba** is recommended as it's a faster alternative to Conda:

* **Install Miniconda/Minimamba:** Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [here](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/mamba-installation.html).

### Step 2: Create the Environment

We have provided a file named `environment.yml` in the root of the repository that specifies all required Python packages and versions.

1.  **Download the `environment.yml` file** from the repository.
2.  **Run the creation command** in your terminal:

    ```bash
    # Use Mamba for faster resolution
    mamba env create -f environment.yml

    # Or use Conda
    # conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3.  **Activate the new environment** to begin working:

    ```bash
    conda activate movieproject2
    ```

### Step 3: Verify Installation

You can quickly check that the core libraries are installed correctly by running a few Python commands in your activated environment:

```python
import pandas
import nilearn
import nibabel
import datalad

print("All dependencies successfully imported.")
